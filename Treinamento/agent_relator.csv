The project "Maiara-Mayavant" is in Stage 1. It is part of the "Pacote Global Dois Em Um" package and was created on February 19, 2024. There has been communication with the client regarding defining a niche and creating a logo. A call has been scheduled to finalize these details and align on the store layout. Although the project is in progress, additional details such as the store name, domain, URL, mined URLs, contact email, and social media links are not available currently. The project is on track but it's necessary to monitor the upcoming stages carefully to ensure compliance with the schedule and client satisfaction.
